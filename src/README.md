## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

Announcements use an optional `starts_on` date and a required `expires_on` date (both in `YYYY-MM-DD`).

All data is stored in MongoDB and seeded from `backend/database.py` when collections are empty.
